## 🚀 Overview

[cite_start]AttndEase is an innovative attendance management solution built to replace traditional, error-prone methods like paper registers and manual signatures. [cite: 39, 40] [cite_start]It combines advanced technologies including ESP32 CYD microcontrollers, QR code scanning, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), React Native mobile applications, and Azure cloud services to create a reliable, real-time, and user-friendly tracking system. [cite: 41]

[cite_start]The system provides transparency for students via real-time attendance records [cite: 24] [cite_start]and offers lecturers accurate, downloadable reports. [cite: 24]

## ✨ Key Features

* [cite_start]Seamless clock-ins using QR code scanning. [cite: 33]
* [cite_start]Secure Bluetooth-based verification to prevent fraudulent entries. [cite: 34]
* [cite_start]Cloud integration via Azure for real-time logging. [cite: 35]
* [cite_start]User dashboards providing personalized attendance summaries. [cite: 37]
* [cite_start]Cross-platform compatibility for both iOS and Android devices. [cite: 30]

## ⚙ How It Works

1.  [cite_start]*Registration:* Administrators register students and lecturers into a central database. [cite: 17]
2.  [cite_start]*Session Generation:* Unique QR codes are generated by the ESP32 CYD device for each lesson. [cite: 18, 28]
3.  [cite_start]*Clock-In (QR):* Students and lecturers scan these QR codes using the AttndEase mobile app to clock in. [cite: 19]
4.  [cite_start]*Verification (BLE):* The system uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) identifiers from the ESP32 CYD to detect user presence within a specific range, verifying attendance in real-time and preventing proxy attendance. [cite: 21, 22]
5.  [cite_start]*Data Sync:* All attendance data is securely transmitted to Azure-hosted APIs for validation and storage. [cite: 29]

## 💻 Tech Stack

* [cite_start]*Mobile:* React Native (for iOS and Android) [cite: 27, 41]
* [cite_start]*Backend:* C# / ASP.NET Core [cite: 67, 531]
* [cite_start]*Hardware:* ESP32 CYD [cite: 27] [cite_start]programmed in C++ (Arduino IDE) [cite: 534]
* [cite_start]*Cloud & Database:* Azure Cloud Services [cite: 27][cite_start], Azure Table Storage [cite: 43, 69][cite_start], and Azure Blob Storage [cite: 43, 69]

## 🏛 High-Level Architecture

The system follows a modular, layered architecture:

* *1. [cite_start]Client Layer:* A React Native mobile app for students, lecturers, and administrators to interact with the system. [cite: 606, 608]
* *2. [cite_start]IoT / Device Layer:* ESP32 CYD devices placed in classrooms to generate QR codes [cite: 619] [cite_start]and scan for BLE UUIDs. [cite: 622]
* *3. [cite_start]Communication Layer:* Uses BLE and QR protocols for device-to-app communication [cite: 629] [cite_start]and HTTPS for securely transmitting data to the backend. [cite: 631]
* *4. [cite_start]Backend / Service Layer:* An Azure-hosted API (C#) that handles all business logic, data processing, and validation. [cite: 634, 638, 67]
* *5. [cite_start]Data / Storage Layer:* Azure Table Storage is used for storing attendance logs and user profiles [cite: 645][cite_start], while Azure Blob Storage handles assets like QR code images. [cite: 681]
